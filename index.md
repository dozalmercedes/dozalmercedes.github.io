### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 2 was enjoyable because we codeded a game-like program that was for two players. Even though it was as simple as the users to enter a number to try and guess the secret number, it was enlightening to know what was may have been considered the basics of how to code for a potential game. The creation of interactive game play was probably something as simple as this. However, it is crazy to believe that what is so simple today was a crucial turning point as well as ground-brekaing in the developement of coding games.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 1 was interesting because it allowed me to see how you use the return function correctly when you want a specific variable found. In this case, it was the area of a rectangle. At first, I did not know what to put so I kept putting 0 like we have previously used it. Obviosuly an error occured because there was no variable created and 0 did not make sense. So, I figured out that a varaible was needed, area, and used that with the reutrn functionn

* Lab 6


    Lab 6 part 2 was awesome to do because not only was it very challenging and difficult to figure out but I also learned how to play Blackjack. I already knew the game of 21 however, involving the dealer and "gambling" was all new to me and made the lab more fun. This program created alot of rethinking and going back to the drawing board during the lab because there was so many loops that were needed due all of the rules and combinations possible in the game. The challenge made it more satusfying once completed.
